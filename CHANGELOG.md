## 1.0.1

**FIRST STABLE RELEASE!**

__Fixed broken link in documentation. Yes, releasing a patch version for it, because details matter when you've waited 3 years to get it right.__

3 years ago, I started building the Flutter map place picker package I wished existed: fully customizable, easy to set up, with all the essential features including search autocomplete.

Back then, I didn't know what MVP meant and tried to support multiple map SDKs at once. Big mistake.

Today, after testing it internally in multiple production apps, it is ready for everyone to use it. Google Maps, simple API, everything you need to ship a map place picker in your distinct app's design system.

Let me know your feedback in [issues](https://github.com/kamranbekirovyz/place-pickarte/issues)
